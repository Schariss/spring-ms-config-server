# The bootstrap file is a specific Spring Cloud file type and is loaded before
# the application.properties or application.yml files. The bootstrap file is used for specifying
# the Spring application name, the Spring Cloud Configuration Git location, encryption/ decryption
# information, and so forth.
# The bootstrap file is loaded by a parent Spring ApplicationContext, and that parent is loaded before
# the one that uses the application properties or YAML files.Â
